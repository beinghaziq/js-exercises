Implement usePrevious Hook
Summary
Create a custom React hook, usePrevious, that keeps track of the previous value of a state variable.
Requirements
* Implement a custom hook called usePrevious that accepts a value and returns the previous value of that state variable.
* Use the usePrevious hook in a simple component to display the previous count value.
Example
When the user clicks the increment or decrement button, the component should display the current count and the previous count.
Example Output: Current Count: 2 Previous Count: 1
Notes
* The focus of this challenge is to understand how to use React hooks, particularly useRef and useEffect, to keep track of previous values.
* You can use the initial code provided in the App component to test your custom hook.
