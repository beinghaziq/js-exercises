Currency Converter
Summary
Develop a currency converter that fetches exchange rates from an API and converts between two currencies.
Requirements
* Create a form with three fields: amount, from currency, and to currency.
* Fetch exchange rates from a free API (e.g., https://api.exchangerate-api.com).
* Convert the amount from the selected "from currency" to the selected "to currency".
* Display the converted amount.
* Handle and display any errors that may occur during the API call.
Notes
* The focus of this challenge is on making API calls and handling user input.
* You may use fetch or any other library to make the API call.
* Provide a default list of currencies to choose from.
